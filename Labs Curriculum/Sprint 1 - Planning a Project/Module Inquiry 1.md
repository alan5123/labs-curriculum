# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions
1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
What key features should a userâ€™s profile or account have? Is there anything inherently different between a regular user and one that is classified as a leader?


2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
-Users should be able to log in to the web application
-Users should be able to create, edit or delete a survey. The user that created a survey is considered the "leader" of that survey. 
-A survey has a list of questions for the leader
-A survey has a lists of questions for a team member. 

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
My favorite user story is the meat of the product which is being able to create a survey.
First we need to give the user the ability to create a survey and provide questions on that, then we need to identify the leader of that survey, we also need to find a way to provide a join code so the leader can send that out.

4. What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
Given a new product roadmap i would maybe we could get even more specific breaking down the tasks.
